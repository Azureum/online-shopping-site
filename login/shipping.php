<h3>Shipping and Handling</h3>
</div>


<p style="text-align: justify;">We are offering worldwide delivery of our products <strong>within 7 to 10 Days Worldwide</strong>. Courier companies do not deliver to P.O. Box address, so we request you to provide full street address with pin code / zip code and telephone / mobile number.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All products are shipped via reputed international courier companies such as DHL, FedEx, UPS and other such renowned companies that are completely insured and reliable. Our Shipping Rates are subsidized and are much lower than what the shipping companies usually charge for international shipments. We always strive to offer our shoppers the lowest shipping charges possible. Please note that shipping companies determine shipping charges based on the package weight.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At the time of delivery, if you are not available to receive the parcel, the courier company would leave a note for you to call them and arrange for re-delivery or you can pick it up from their location.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We are not responsible for any delay caused by any unforeseen time lags by the courier companies in delivering the parcels to the customer, or if the customer is not available at the time of delivery.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Please note that there are no shipments made from the store on Sundays and public holidays as our logistics partner, does not make any pick-ups on those days.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We will send you an email regarding the shipment of your order, as soon as the items are handed over to the Courier Company. These alert emails will contain the tracking number and Courier Company’s website detail. Tracking numbers for orders shipped might take 24 business hours to become active on the courier websites.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Please note that if there are any customs or duties applicable for the ordered items, it would be billed separately to the customer by the courier company at the time of delivery. The duties and taxes are not a part of the customer’s payment made to us. VAT / Custom Taxes and Import Duties are not in our control. They vary according to the rules of different countries and must be paid directly by the buyer. VAT / Custom Taxes and Import Duties are not included in our ordering process, but may be charged to you by your government.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">International customers are responsible for any customs or duty fees levied by their country. We have no control over these charges and cannot predict whether they will occur, as policies vary greatly from nation to nation. They are entirely your responsibility. The courier company may also charge some additional service charges over and above custom duty on case to case basis.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Times to ship mentioned on our website against each item are indicative and approximate values only and sometimes due to situations beyond our control, delays may occur. No refund, returns, replacement &amp; exchange will be entertained for this reason.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If, for any reason, there is going to be a delay in shipping because a item is out of stock or If there is an unusual delay in filling an order, we will notify you by e-mail.</p>
